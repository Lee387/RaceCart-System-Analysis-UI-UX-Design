# RaceCart-System-Analysis-UI-UX-Design

## About
Designed the user and admin interfaces for RacerCart, a mobile application for managing go-kart rentals. This project extended beyond interface design into comprehensive system analysis and modeling.

## Goal
To deliver a robust and scalable system design that supports the full rental process while providing clear structures for both user interactions and backend administration.

## Process
Produced key deliverables including activity diagrams, use case descriptions, system sequence diagrams, system architecture, database design, and class diagrams. Additional outputs included first-cut and three-layer sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, CRC cards, and package diagrams, ensuring a well-documented and structured design for implementation.
